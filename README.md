## Controls
The **escape** key will close the application.\
The **first trackbar** on the left will change the amount of processes used for the simulation.\
The **second trackbar** on the left will change the time quantum for the round robin scheduling algorithm.\
The **go button** will start a new simulation with the parameters specified by the trackbars and display the new statistics and Gantt charts.

## TODO
* Add priority scheduling.
* Add shortest time remaining first scheduling.
